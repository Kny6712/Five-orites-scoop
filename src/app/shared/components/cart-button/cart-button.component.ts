/**
 * Cart button for a page toolbar.
 *
 * Usage — wrap it in `ion-buttons` and put *that* in the toolbar's `end` slot:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ion-toolbar color="primary">
 *   <ion-buttons slot="start">
 *     <ion-menu-button></ion-menu-button>
 *   </ion-buttons>
 *   <ion-title>Our Flavors</ion-title>
 *   <ion-buttons slot="end">
 *     <app-cart-button></app-cart-button>
 *   </ion-buttons>
 * </ion-toolbar>
 * ```
 *
 * Do NOT put `slot="end"` on this component's host instead. It is tempting,
 * because `ion-toolbar` is a shadow-DOM component that orders its children
 * with `::slotted([slot=end]) { order: 6 }` — but `order` only applies to a
 * generated box, and `display: contents` (needed here to strip out the wrapper)
 * generates none. The `order: 6` is silently discarded, the inner `ion-button`
 * is promoted straight into the toolbar's flex container, and it lands at the
 * initial `order: 0` — ahead of `ion-title` at `order: 3`. The button then
 * renders immediately to the left of the page title instead of hard right,
 * which is exactly where it does not belong.
 *
 * Going through `ion-buttons` avoids all of that: it is a real box, so it keeps
 * `order: 6` and `text-align: end`; `ion-toolbar.componentWillLoad` also finds
 * it via its `querySelectorAll('ion-buttons')` pass and tags it
 * `buttons-last-slot` for the trailing margin. Inside it, `display: contents`
 * is harmless because `ion-buttons` is itself `display: flex` — the promoted
 * `ion-button` is simply a flex item, and nothing inside needs reordering.

    /* No font-size override on the icon on purpose: Ionic already sizes it via
       ::slotted(ion-icon[slot=icon-only]) { font-size: 1.8em }, and that rule
       outranks anything set from here, so a local value would be dead code.
       At 1.8em (~29px) inside a button that ion-buttons pads by 8px per side,
       the glyph's edge already sits ~8px clear of the button edge — which is
       what lets the count sit mostly outside the cart rather than on top of it. */

    /* A plain span, deliberately not <ion-badge>. ion-badge is a shadow-DOM
       component whose :host sets display:inline-block, font-size:0.8125rem and
       3px vertical padding, so pinning a height on it leaves the digit riding
       high in the bubble — overriding those from a document-level class means
       winning a tree-context cascade against the shadow stylesheet, which is
       fragile and browser-dependent. It also carries contain:content (paint
       containment), which clips at the padding box. A span has neither problem.

       Flex centring is what actually centres the digit: an inline-block with a
       fixed height just parks the line box at the top. box-sizing is stated
       because Ionic resets it globally, which would otherwise treat the height
       as content-box and let the padding skew the bubble. border-radius:999px
       keeps it a true circle for one digit and turns it into a pill for two. */

         centre on the cart glyph's top-right, matching the reference design. */
